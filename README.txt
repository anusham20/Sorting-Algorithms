Sorting Algorithms
Author: Anusha Maheshwari

This folder contains Python implementations of various sorting algorithms.

Bubble Sort: "BubbleSort.py"
- Bubble Sort is a sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- Big O Efficiency: 
    - Worst case: O(n^2)
    - Best case: O(n)

QuickSort: "Quicksort.py"
- QuickSort is a divide and conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.
- Big O Efficiency:
    - Worst case: O(n^2)
    - Best case: O(nlog(n))

Insertion Sort: "InsertionSort.py"
- Insertion Sort is a sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It takes each element from an unsorted part and places it in its correct position within the sorted part.
- Big O Efficiency: 
    - Worst case: O(n^2)
    - Best case: O(n)

Merge Sort: "MergeSort.py"
- Merge Sort is an efficient, stable, and comparison-based sorting algorithm. It divides the unsorted list into n sublists until each list contains only one element and then merges these sublists to produce a sorted final list.
- Big O Efficiency: O(nlog(n))
